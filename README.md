-----Treehouse Project 6------

Hello! Welsome to my portfolio!!!

I'm going for exceeds and as far as I can see, everything looks to be about right.

error template is set up and rendered correctly.
The porfolio should launch on port 3000 by entering npm start

Notes for CSS changes to achieve exceeds.
1. Background changed on left side info div.
2. Box shadow changed on project thumbnails when a user hovers. 
3. Project thumbnails  also have a small transition here to enlarge the image.
4. Various fonts changed to raleway and questrial.

All of my routing has been done inside the app.js file, I wasn't sure whether the routing should be done in app.js, or to create seperate route modules and I was a little time restricted on the project so everything is all in app.js for now.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project :)
